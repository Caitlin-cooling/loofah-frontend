    "At this level, your main focus is on learning your craft. This is where our graduates start out, but we also hire directly into this grade. " ,
    "You are expected to learn quickly, to keep an open mind, to ask for help constructively, and to contribute where you can.\nYou are part of a formal traineeship programme that aims to teach you how to be an effective consultant and a good developer.This typically lasts two years. ",
    "If you have joined via the graduate intake you will need to complete the requirements of the Analyst Induction Programme (AIP) as well as meeting the standards of a Developer. If you were hired directly into the Analyst Developer grade, you will not complete all the formalities of the AIP, but you should review the training available on the AIP with your coach to decide which would be helpful for you given your background. The requirements of the AIP also highlight some of the breadth required from a career in consulting which may not have been the case in your previous experience."

  [gradeKeys.DEVELOPER]: [
    "You are no longer a trainee, but that doesn't mean you've stopped learning. You have useful, core skills in one or more technologies that you can apply in a project context, and you are starting to move beyond the precise practices you were taught, gaining a better understanding of the underlying principles that make them work."
  ],
  [gradeKeys.SENIOR_DEVELOPER]: [
    "You are now responsible not just for the impact you make with your own work, but also for your wider impact on others, for example by leading small teams, inspiring people, taking greater responsibility for the quality and architecture of the solution, and/or building productive client relationships. You'll also start to play a bigger role in the practice and our internal community."
  ],
  [gradeKeys.TECHNICAL_LEAD]: [
    "You are now considered an expert at what you do. You might be the most senior technologist on your project, and your clients will start to see you as the face of our technical delivery. You'll be responsible for the work of several teams, either in a managerial capacity, in a coaching and quality assurance role, or as a solution architect. The solution we are building has your name on it, so you're going to care passionately about its quality. ",
    "You'll be inspirational to our people and our clients, and you might play a big part in our practice, for example by leading a technical community or taking ownership over things like recruitment or learning. You'll also start to build a team around you, some of whom you will take with you as you move between projects. These people will start to see you as vital to their own career growth"
  ],
  [gradeKeys.SENIOR_TECHNICAL_LEAD]: [
    "You are now a junior member of our leadership team. You'll be involved in bigger projects and responsible for more complex solutions â€“ solutions that your clients might consider business-critical.

    "Senior Technical Lead is the first grade for which you need to present a business case and participate in an evaluation process that includes a panel interview. The business case is an opportunity for you to articulate what you do, and how it is additive to the firm and our clients. You should expect to invest significant time and effort into developing and articulating your business case, working with a range of mentors and senior supporters along the way"

  [gradeKeys.TECHNICAL_DIRECTOR]: [
    "This is a senior leadership role in our business. What you do will be very personal to you and your career. You will have presented a specific business case for your promotion, which you are now executing on"
